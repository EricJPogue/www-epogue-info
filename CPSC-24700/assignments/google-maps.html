        <h3>Google Maps</h3>

        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>We are going to utilize the Google Maps JavaScript API to create a game where the player needs to search 
            Google Maps to find several of your favorite places.</p>
        <p>The game works by displaying Google’s Maps interface on the page and allowing the user to pan and zoom in 
            order to find one of several predefined locations. The goal of the game is, for a given location, to zoom 
            in closely (to a predefined zoom level = 8) such that the location is within the bounds of the map. Once the 
            player finds that location, his or her score will be increased by 1 and the location will be then changed to 
            another from a predefined sequence.</p>
        <p>You are free to select the particular locations and the sequence in which they must be found. To help the 
            player find the right location, you should display a hint message if the location can be found on the 
            currently shown portion of the map within the current zoom level. The hints should be more specific as the 
            user zooms in. For example, for zoom level 2, you may display “You are getting there!”, for zoom level 3, 
            you may display “You’re getting close”, for zoom level 4, you may display “You’re getting closer”, etc.</p> 

        <h4>What You Need to Know</h4>
        <p>For this assignment you will need to know: the basics of JavaScript including:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>HTML</li>
            <li>CSS</li>
            <li>JavaScript</li>
            <li>Google Maps JavaScript API (see Getting Started with Google Maps JavaScript API section below)</li>
        </ul> 

        <h4>Getting Started with Google Maps JavaScript API</h4>
        <p>The Google Maps JavaScript API is a broadly used and sophisticated Web API. It can be a little daunting at 
            first. However, the following steps should get you started:
        <ul>
            <li>Start by completing the Google Maps JavaScript Getting Started tutorial 
                <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/tutorial" target="_blank">
                [Link]</a></li>
            <li>After you have your Google Maps API key and have successfully completed the tutorial try to understand 
                how the Maps API works by looking at the API reference to see the possible properties, methods, and 
                events you can use in your
                program</li>
            <li>Copy the "Hello World" example HTML file and make sure it runs locally... make sure to replace the 
                "YOUR_API_KEY" with your actuall key</li>
            <li>Once you have Hello World example working, review the JavaScript Event Listeners documentation
                <a href="https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/events" target="_blank">
                [Link]</a> to understand how you will add event listenders to your map (you will need to add a 
                "bounds_changed" event at a minimum)</li>
            <li>Review the "Google Maps Garage: Where's My Map!" video 
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=21PDd17dnnI&feature=youtu.be" target="_blank">
                [Link]</a> if you are having difficulty with your map showing up in the browser
            <li>Experiment with:
            <ul>
                <li>Creating a new location using the LatLng constructor similar to:<br>
                    var loc1 = new LatLng(12.432, 43.234);</li>
                <li>Checking if a location is within the bounds by using the map.getBounds().contains(loc) method, 
                    where loc is the variable holding a LatLng object above</li>
                <li>Getting the current zoom level using the map.getZoom() method</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Also note that are a number of very good Google Maps API tutorials available on YouTube including the 
                one called "Google Maps JavaScript API Tutorial"
                <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxf1mnP5zcw&t=820s" target="_blank">
                [Link]</a>
        </ul> 

        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <p>The web page should be hosted on your Azure website and contain the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Header text (your names, project#, course name, semester) </li>
            <li>Game title</li>
            <li>The Google Maps interface</li>
            <li>Text with the hints that guide the player</li>
            <li>The score display</li>
            <li>A separate "Getting Started" section that provides an overview and explains how to play from a user 
                perspective</li>
        </ul> 
        <p><strong>Styling:</strong> All elements in the web page should be styled using CSS3. You will be graded based 
            on the styling and ease of use. You should ask at least one other person to try the game without your 
            input. Watch them and listen to their feedback.</p> 
        <p><strong>Event Processing:</strong> When the page loads, initialize the zoom level to 1 and the center of the 
            map to be (0.0, 0.0). Then initialize the current location to be the first in a list that you hard code 
            into the script.</p> 
        <p>If the center of the map changes, check if the current location is within the map bounds (using the 
            map.getBounds() method) and update the hint text. Also, check for the scoring condition (within bounds and 
            zoom level = 8). If the player scored (i.e. found the location), alert the user, update the score and choose 
            the next location on the list. Check if the game is over. If it is over, redirect the browser’s window to a 
            game over html page, which will display the text “Game Over. You Won!”</p>
        <p>If the zoom level changes, do the same as above, but also make the hint text more specific as the zoom 
            increases. You should have a different hint text for each zoom level from 1 to 8.</p>
        <p>Note: both the change of the map center and a change in the zoom level will cause the bounds_changed event to 
            occur. So you can just make your code respond to that one event by implementing the appropriate event 
            handling function.</p>

        <h4>Additional Requirements</h4>
        <p>The following additional items should also be completed as part of the assignment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Separate your HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code into separate files and hosted on your Azure website</li>
            <li>Include a block comment containing your name, course name, project number, and semester at the top of 
                each file</li>
            <li>Verify that your page should display correctly when using the Google Chrome browser</li>
            <li>Validate your HTML5 file using the W3C validator service... Google search "HTML validator" or "CSS 
                validator" if you are having difficulty finding the W3C validation service</li>
            <li>Utilize proper programming style including the use of whitespace (line breaks and indents) to separate 
                sections of your code</li>
            <li>Your code should produce no errors or warning during validation/execution</li>
            <li>Your code needs to follow proper programming style including use of whitespace (line breaks and indents) 
                to separate sections of your code and comments to document the your</li>
        </ul>   

        <h4>What to Submit</h4>
        <p>When submitting the project through Blackboard:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Submit a single HTML file named "google-maps-project-xxx.html" where "xxx" are your initials in lower 
                case</li>
            <li>Include a block comment containing your name, course name, project number, and semester at the top of 
                the file</li>
            <li>Include a brief summary of your experience with the project (what you were able to accomplish and what 
                you were not able to complete)</li>
            <li>Include a direct link to your project and and additioanl link to your Azure landing page that links
                to all of your projects and labs</li>
            <li>Include a list of locations that represent the winning sequenceof locations, e.g.: “Chicago” “New York” 
                “Barcelona”... test and make sure that it works 
            <li>Optionally include any comments/suggestions on how this project could be improved</li> 
        </ul>
