        <h3>Contact Manager Sever/Database</h3>
        <h4>Overview</h4>
        <p>We are going to develop the the server side of our Contact Manager application that we developed 
            previously.</p>
        <p>For this project you will need to design a server side process and database where contacts can 
            be created, read (in memory), updated (in memory), and deleted (CRUD features). You should prepopulate 
            your Contact Manager database with a list of at least 10 contacts. 
        </p>
        <p>The server side process and database should also support the ability to dynamically search your contacts 
            by typing in a search field and updating a list so that it contains only the contacts that meet the 
            current pattern of characters in currently in the search field. The search field should also support 
            regular expressions; however, if the user types in a regular expression, the search should not occur 
            until the regular expression is completed.
        </p>
        <p>At a minimum your server and database should contain fields for Name (you can decide whether you want to 
            break it into first, last, middle), multiple addresses (home, work, other would be possibilities), multiple phone 
            numbers, birthday, age, notes, and the ability to add custom fields.   
        </p>
         <p>For the purposes of this project, we will be assuming only US English language, addresses, phone numbers, 
             etc. However, It would be beneficial to spend a couple minutes considering what it would take to implement a 
             US Spanish, or Australian English, or Indian Hindi version of the application.   
        </p>
        <p>In addition to proper validation (phone number, state, birthdays, etc.), proper calculations (age based on 
            birthday, etc.), your application should make use of some level of auto completion. For example, if a zip 
            code is added for Chicago, you should default your city and state to Chicago and IL respectively.  
        </p>

        </ul> 

        <h4>Requirements</h4>
        <p>The Contact Manager client web page should continue to be hosted on your Azure website and contain the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Header text (your names, project#, course name, semester)</li>
            <li>Application Title</li>
            <li>Your design and implementation of a Contact Manager UI</li>
            <li>A separate "Getting Started" or "Help" section that provides an overview of your application and 
                explains how to use it from a user perspective</li>
        </ul> 
        <p><strong>Styling:</strong> All elements in the web page should be styled using CSS3. You will be graded based 
            on the styling and ease of use. You should ask at least one other person to try the game without your 
            input. Watch them and listen to their feedback.</p> 
        <p><strong>Event Processing:</strong> You will need to utilize event processing in several areas in this
