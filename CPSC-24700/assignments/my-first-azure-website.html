    </p> 
    <p>Before you start the video, there are a couple of notes/suggestions:
    <ul>
        <li>The video is produced at high resolution so depending on your screen resolution, you may need to scroll down to start or pause the video</li>
        <li>Similarly, it may be easier to see details in the video if it is displayed full screen</li>
        <li>Note that it is possible to utilize Windows drag-and-drop in Filezilla instead of the file selection method shown in the video</li>
        <li>Once you have completed the above video and setup "Hello World -HTML" on Azure, log back into your account and:
            <ol>
                <li>Deploy your Project 1 to your Azure website</li>
                <li>Deploy your Week 3 Lab to your Azure website</li>
                <li>Deploy your Week 4 Lab to your Azure website</li>
            </ol>
        <li>Finally, create a visually appealing landing page called 'index.html' that provides visually appealing labels and links in the form:</li>
            <ul>
                <li>Project 1 - My Favorite Hobbie [link]</li>
                <li>Project 2 - First Azure Website Hello World [link]</li>
                <li>Week 3 Lab - ... [link] where "..." is the name of the lab</li>
                <li>Week 4 Lab - ... [link]</li>
                <li>etc.</li>
            </ul>
    </ul>
    </p>

    </p>         
    <p><em><strong>What you Need to Know</strong></em><br>
