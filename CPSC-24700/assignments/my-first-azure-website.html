    </p> 
    <p>Before you start the video, there are a couple of notes/suggestions:
    <ul>
        <li>The video is produced at high resolution so depending on your screen resolution, you may need to scroll down to start or pause the video</li>
        <li>Similarly, it may be easier to see details in the video if it is displayed full screen</li>
        <li>Note that it is possible to utilize Windows drag-and-drop in Filezilla instead of the file selection method shown in the video</li>
        <li>Once you have completed the above video and setup "Hello World -HTML" on Azure, log back into your account and deploy your Project 1 to your Azure website</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p><em><strong>Additional Requirements</strong></em><br>
        Additional requirements are provided in the video.
